            Empowering communities economically is a fundamental step toward eradicating poverty. Local entrepreneurship and small-scale businesses play a crucial role in creating sustainable livelihoods. Governments and organizations can support community-driven initiatives by providing access to credit, facilitating skill development programs, and promoting market linkages. When communities have the tools to generate income locally, they become more resilient to economic shocks.
